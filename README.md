# Data Structures and Algoritms practice

## I aim to keep track of my data structures and algorithm practices in this repo.

### I use javascript to solve the problems, but logic applies to any other programming language.

### I try to solve questions using both iteration and recursion, then calculate the Big-O.

### I try my best to explain my thought process as comments. Any suggestion is well appreciated.

### This is not a guide or a tutorial, I just would like to follow my own progress, we're all gonna make it.
